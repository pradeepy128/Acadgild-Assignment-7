Task 1
Given a list of strings - List[String] (“alpha”, “gamma”, “omega”, “zeta”, “beta”)

- Find count of all strings with length 4.
- Convert the list of string to a list of integers, where each string is mapped to its corresponding length.
- Find count of all strings which contain alphabet ‘m’.
- Find the count of all strings which start with the alphabet ‘a’.


Task 2
Create a list of tuples, where the 1st element of the tuple is an int and the second
element is a string.
Example - ((1, ‘alpha’), (2, ‘beta’), (3, ‘gamma’), (4, ‘zeta’), (5, ‘omega’))

- For the above list, print the numbers where the corresponding string length is 4.
- find the average of all numbers, where the corresponding string contains alphabet ‘m’ or alphabet ‘z’
